# RH Public — Static Mock‑up

This is a lightweight, single‑file prototype using Tailwind CDN.
It mirrors the KM structure at a high level and is fully responsive.

## Quick Start
Just open `index.html` in your browser, or host via any static host (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).

## Next Step Options
- Migrate to **Astro** or **Next.js** for a full site.
- Add Markdown‑powered docs and shared components.
- Hook up forms/analytics as needed.
